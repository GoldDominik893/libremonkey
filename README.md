## LibreMonkey - create forms without spyware

> [!CAUTION]
> It is strongly not reccommended to deploy this software for production as there may be SQL injection vulnerabilities and there may also be a few other security vulnerabilities such as editing the fields in a form when you are not even logged in.

### Features

- Create Surveys
    - view responses
    - users can also view all their responses
    - **in a future update form owners can get averages for user responses or analytics.*
- No third party advertisements or data monetisation.
- It's Free Open Source Software, the free use is dependant on the instance operator.

### How it works

LibreMonkey uses the PHP backend alongside MySQL to store surveys and survey responses. LibreMonkey is the clear winner when in comparison to all the others because it is fast and does not sell your data.
